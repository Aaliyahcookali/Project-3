Project 3
This project was created by a single student, Aaliyah Cook-Ali, focusing on the cannabis market and analyzing which part of the market to invest in: adult-use or medical.
The analysis utilized a dataset available from the following link: [https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/cannabis-retail-sales-by-week-ending].
After reviewing the outcomes of the data cleaning, grouping, and other techniques that helped aid in the selection of which cannabis stock should be selected specializing in the sale of adult-use cannabis not medical. 
Utilizing the cleaned, split, trained, predicted, and evaluated CGC_XNAS.csv dataset, I found that CGC stock could present a great investment, when considering additional factors to make that decision.
