Project 3
This project was created by a single student, Aaliyah Cook-Ali, focusing on the cannabis market and analyzing which part of the market to invest in: adult-use or medical.
The analysis utilized a dataset available from the following link: [https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/cannabis-retail-sales-by-week-ending].
After reviewing the outcomes of the data cleaning, grouping, and other techniques that help aid in concluding the selection of a stock should focus on a company specializing in the sale of adult-use cannabis. 
Utilizing the cleaned, split, trained, predicted, and evaluated CGC_XNAS.csv dataset, I found that CGC stock could present a great investment, when considering additional factors to make that decision.
